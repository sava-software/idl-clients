## What this repository is

This repo makes it easy to interact with on-chain Solana programs from Java —
both calling instructions and reading/deserializing on-chain data. It contains:

- **Generated source** — per-program Java code (instruction builders, account
  and type (de)serialization, PDA helpers, error enums) generated from each
  program's IDL by the companion **idl-src-gen** project (a separate repository).
  Generation is driven by `main_net_programs.json`, which maps each program to
  its module, package, program id, IDL type (Anchor/Codama/Shank), and IDL
  source. Locally stored IDLs live under `idls/`; each generated package also
  keeps the `idl.json` it was generated from next to the source in its `gen/`
  directory.
- **Hand-written convenience layers** — clients, accounts registries, PDA
  helpers, and utilities layered on top of the generated static functions to
  ease integration (e.g. `MeteoraDlmmClient`/`Impl`, `OrcaWhirlpoolsClient`/`Impl`,
  `*Accounts`, `*PDAs`, `*RemainingAccounts`).

### Module layout

- `idl-clients-spl/` — SPL / core programs (token, ATA, lookup tables, ...) and
  shared generated commons.
- `idl-clients-bundle/` — the bulk of third-party programs (Jupiter, Kamino,
  Meteora, Orca, Marginfi, Metaplex, Squads, oracles, ...), plus REST API
  clients for off-chain services (e.g. Jupiter swap/ultra APIs).
- `idl-clients-drift/` — Drift. Dead code for now — not actively maintained;
  don't invest effort here unless asked.

Within a program's package, `gen/` is generated code — **never hand-edit it**.
Fixes to generated output belong in the idl-src-gen generator; then regenerate.
Everything outside `gen/` is hand-written and safe to edit.

## Why the hand-written layer exists (IDL limitations)

An IDL can only communicate so much:

- It declares an instruction's account list, but often not **how to derive**
  those accounts (PDA seeds, ATAs), which ones are optional, which have
  sentinel/default values, or which are auto-wired well-known programs
  (system, token, memo, sysvars).
- It says nothing about **remaining accounts** conventions — e.g. Token-2022
  transfer-hook account resolution, or supplemental tick arrays on Whirlpool
  swaps — which must be appended beyond the declared account list.
- Argument semantics (units, scaling, valid ranges, sentinel values) and
  multi-instruction flows are not expressible.
- Some teams **forget to publish the IDL** when deploying, or publish stale
  IDLs that lag the deployed program.

Figuring out the accounts and data an instruction actually needs is therefore
often real investigative work. The handwritten clients encode the results of
that work — which is exactly why they must be kept in sync with the programs
themselves, not just the IDL.

## Keeping in sync with the Rust source

The IDL is a lossy artifact; the program's **Rust source is the ground truth**.
When writing or updating convenience functionality, reference the actual Rust
source whenever it is available:

- Read the instruction handler and its `#[derive(Accounts)]` context (Anchor)
  or manual account parsing (native/Shank) to confirm account order,
  writability, signers, optionality, PDA seeds, and any `remaining_accounts`
  handling.
- Check constants, error enums, and event/discriminator definitions against
  the source rather than trusting the IDL alone.
- When a program has no published IDL (or a stale one), the Rust source — or,
  failing that, on-chain transaction inspection — is the only reliable way to
  build correct instructions.
- When behavior changes upstream (new instruction versions, re-ordered or
  auto-wired accounts), update the generated code via idl-src-gen where the
  IDL covers it, and update the hand-written clients for everything the IDL
  cannot express.

Reference clones of program repositories (and core repos like Agave and the
Solana SDK) are kept locally for this purpose. Machine-specific locations —
where idl-src-gen and the reference clones live on this machine — are recorded
in `AGENTS.local.md`, which is git-ignored; consult it (and add to it) rather
than putting local paths in this file. If a needed program repo is not yet
cloned, clone it into the reference directory listed there.

## Build & test

GitHub Packages credentials are required for dependency resolution, in
`~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties
savaGithubPackagesUsername=GITHUB_USERNAME
savaGithubPackagesPassword=GITHUB_TOKEN
```

```shell
./gradlew check                                # full build + tests
./gradlew :idl-clients-bundle:compileJava      # compile one module
./gradlew :idl-clients-bundle:test             # test one module
```

Integration-style tests named `Integ.*` are git-ignored scratch files.

## Conventions

- Conventional commits; releases are cut by release-please (`fix:`/`feat:`
  bump patch/minor; a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer bumps major).
- The root `.gitignore` is a whitelist: everything at the repo root is ignored
  unless explicitly re-included. New top-level files/directories that should be
  tracked must be added there.
- Generated code style (two-space indent, `final` params, records) is set by
  the generator; hand-written code follows the same style.
